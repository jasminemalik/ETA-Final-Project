# ETA Final Project
Final Project for DS5001, Exploratory Text Analytics by Dr. Alvarado. 

This final project analyzes a corpus of English Novels by using topics such as PCA, LDA, Sentiment Analysis, and Word Vectorization. The full report can be found in both pdf and Jupyter notebook format in the main branch. The tables created during the process are in the Tables Created folder, and this includes tables such as the CORPUS, VOCAB, and LIB files in csv format, along with some others. Extra Jupyter Notebook files that were created during this analysis are also included in the folder above.
